# GitStake - A simple tool to add a layer of authentication to your git server

## Problem

The git protocol has no integrated authentication mechanism. This is not a problem if you have a dedicated server for your git repositories but if you want to host your repositories on a shared server you have to rely on the filesystem to protect your repositories. Managing the filesystem permissions is not very convenient, can be a source of errors and will not work at scale.

Your app might also need to access your app's database. Using the filesystem means that you duplicate the authentication mechanism
when you might just want to use your app's authentication mechanism.

## Solution

GitStake is a simple tool that will allow you to add a layer of authentication to your git server. It will allow you to add an
authentication layer to ssh connections to your git repositories.

## How does it work ?

    A[Start] --> B[Client pushes his code]
    B --> C{Is the user's public key in the authorized_keys file ?}
    C -->|Yes| D[Execute git stake binary]
    C -->|No| E[Reject the connection]
    D --> F[Chech the executed command]
    F --> G{Is the command git-receive-pack 'repo.git' ?}
    G -->|Yes| H[Check if the user has the right to push on the repo in the database]
    G -->|No| E
    H --> I{Can the user push on the repo ?}
    I -->|Yes| J[Execute git-receive-pack 'repo.git']
    I -->|No| E
    J --> K[End]
```

GitStake is a wrapper around the git-receive-pack command. It will check if the user has the right to push on the repository and if he does it will execute git-receive-pack 'repo.git'. If he doesn't it will reject the connection.

To make sure the script is executed when the ssh connection is made, you need to prefix the public key in the authorized_keys file with the following command followed the a space and the user's public key:

```bash
command="/path/to/gitstake-binary <username-id>"
```
